## Introduction
The **Iglu Controller** is the heart of the Iglu Project. It is a GUI to create, modify and delete [Iglu Caches](/docs/Components/Iglu%20Cache). In addition, you can configure build jobs to automatically spin up [Iglu Builders](/docs/Components/Iglu%20Builder) and build [nix derivations](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.25/language/derivations). Those derivations will be pushed to a [cachix](https://www.cachix.org/) client compatible cache, like our [Iglu Cache](/docs/Components/Iglu%20Cache).
