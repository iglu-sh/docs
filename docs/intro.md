# Introducing Iglu

## What is Iglu?
**Iglu** is an easy to use cache for nix derivations. So that you don't have to build your derivations (packages, configurations, ...) multipletimes.
You can use the official [cachix](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cachix) client to push derivations to your own Iglu cache.

## Why Iglu?
Iglu was build to improve the usability of nix caches for normal users and organisations. We tested much caches, like

- [attic](https://github.com/zhaofengli/attic/)
- [cachix](https://www.cachix.org/)
- [cache-server](https://github.com/mifka01/cache-server)
- [nix-serve](https://github.com/edolstra/nix-serve)

Sadly, all of these didn't fit our requirements for a stable, multi-tenant implemenation that could be used with the cachix client.
So we ([SirBerg](https://github.com/SirBerg) and [Svenum](https://github.com/Svenum)) decided to build our own cache!
We want to provide these features:

- A simple UI to manage all caches
- A stable and userfriendly experience
- A way to build and upload derivations easyliy and automated by a builtin [builder](https://github.com/iglu-sh/builder)
- An easy-to-use and easy-to-maintain codebase for either forking or colaboration

## Comparison
Here are some comparison to other caches:
- ✅: supported
