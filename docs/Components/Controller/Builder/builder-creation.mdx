## How are builders started?
Builders (or rather the containers) are not started directly by the Iglu Controller, but rather a Scheduler Server. This Scheduler server runs in the background and starts the containers when a new build is requested / according to a cron schedule.
The Scheduler Server is automatically setup when you spin up the Iglu Controller, so you don't have to worry about it.
The Files for this Scheduler are located unter `lib/scheduler` in the Iglu Controller repository.
## How does the Iglu Controller communicate with Builders / The Scheduler?
All of these compontens communicate via this schema:

## How can I add a new Builder?
Well first you can create one via the Iglu Controller UI in the "Builders" section.
You can also create a new Builder via the Rest API of the Iglu Controller. This API is documented here: [Iglu Controller API](/docs/API/Iglu%20Controller/create-a-new-builder)
